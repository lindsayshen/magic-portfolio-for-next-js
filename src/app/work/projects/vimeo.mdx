## Case Study: Improving the Video Analytics Experience

A close friend of mine works at Vimeo's video analytics team. One day, he told me about his concerns about the poor customer feedback he received on the analytics user experiences. A redesign idea then started to sprout…

### Case Study Brief

**Product:** A redesigned responsive website for Vimeo's video analytics section.

**My Roles:** UX/UI Design, User Research, Wireframing, Low/High-Fidelity Design, Prototyping, Usability Testing, Design Validation

**Framework:** Lean UX

**Tool:** Figma

### Project Background

My engineer friend who works at Vimeo's video analytics team told me about the poor customer feedback they received regarding the video analytics user experiences. He also mentioned that his team would love to make improvements on the UX/UI design for this section, but hasn't had a chance to allocate time to this due to other more prioritized projects.


### Challenges

- Redesign and optimize the use of the dashboard page
- Redesign and streamline the filtering process
- Add new features that most customers need

## Think

Special thanks to Xiaoxin Ouyang (product manager) who contributed her valuable time, effort, and insights during this research process.

### Step 1

Understand Vimeo's design language and the video analytics section's design and feature. 


### Step 2

Read, categorize, and summarize over 6000 feedbacks from the Customer Satisfaction Report.

### Step 3

Do market research on competitors' video analytics feature and summarize for improvements.


### Research Results

After doing the 3 steps shown above, we documented a lot of findings and the following table provides a glance shot at some main issues we found (some company sensitive content is blurred).

### High-Fidelity Designs

#### Dashboard Redesign

**Main issues**
- Poor space usage - requires constant scrolling to find basic information
- Limited data insights - key metrics buried instead of visualized
- No user control - can't customize, export, or share reports
![image](/images/projects/vimeo/hf1.png)

**My design solution**
- Streamline layout: collapsible side menu, minimal header margins, key content above the fold
- Space optimization: combine stat widgets and charts to display critical data at first glance
- Enhanced functionality: add header icons for customizing dashboard layout, saving custom views, exporting as PDF, sharing dashboard, and reporting issues

#### Filter Redesign

**Main issues**
- Requires too many clicks 
- Can't filter videos by folder; has limitations on showing video names
- Doesn't provide save filter feature
![image](/images/projects/vimeo/f1.gif)

**My design solution**
- Streamlined filtering: combine all filters on one page with auto-apply, eliminating extra clicks
- Enhanced video organization: folder-based filtering, expanded space for full video titles, and avoid using truncated names
- Improved filter management: saveable filter presets, fixed bottom panel showing active filters, and clear category-by-category selection overview

#### Reports Redesign

**Main issues**
- Different types of reports are on different pages; can only edit secondary dimension for the table
- Can't manage or reorder table columns
- Can only download CSV file, report issue when the CSAT questionnaire pops up; can't share the page
![image](/images/projects/vimeo/r1.png)
**My design solution**
- Unified report view: combined data in one table, primary dimension selector dropdown, and streamlined data analysis
- Flexible column management: toggle columns on/off, drag-and-drop reordering, and customizable data display
- Enhanced header controls: download report, share view, report issues

#### Single Video Analytics (New Feature)

Customers are now able to get comprehensive knowledge about any single video that they published. From how the impressions led to the total watch time to where the majority of viewers are located at; from how the audiences engage with each second of the video to how the video performed this week compared to last week, and more. Users can customize the graph's dimensions according to their own preferences. They will even get tips on how to improve their future contents. 


<div
style={{
    display: "flex", 
    flexDirection: "row",
    flexWrap: "wrap",
    alignItems: "center",
    gap: "2rem",  
    margin: "2rem 0",
  }}
>
  <div style={{
    flex: "1 1 300px",
    minWidth: "300px",
  }}>
  <b>Video's version</b>

  <b>Special feature for webinar’s version -></b>
  <li> Account that hosts webinar sessions will be able to see an email list of their audience. </li>
  <li> Cards above the email list table highlights some important data for account owner to skim through. </li>

  </div>
  <div style={{
    flex: "1 1 300px",
    minWidth: "300px",
      display: "flex",
    flexDirection: "column",
    justifyContent: "center",
    alignItems: "center",
    textAlign: "center",
  }}>
  <b> Webinar (live stream)'s version </b>

  </div>
</div>

#### Report Settings (New Feature)

Users can now organize all the previously downloaded reports and saved filters in the Report Settings Page now.

<div
style={{
    display: "flex", 
    flexDirection: "row",
    flexWrap: "wrap",
    alignItems: "center",
    gap: "2rem",  
    margin: "2rem 0",
  }}
>
  <div style={{
    flex: "1 1 300px",
    minWidth: "300px",
  }}>
  <b>Download Center</b>

    flex: "1 1 300px",
    minWidth: "300px",
      display: "flex",
    flexDirection: "column",
    justifyContent: "center",
    alignItems: "center",
    textAlign: "center",
  }}>
  <b>Filter Settings</b>

  </div>
</div>

## Check

After a few quick testings with some users and meetings with Vimeo engineers, we identified a few issues and make changes right away.

  - It's more user friendly to put filter categories horizontally on the top
  - The bars at the top need stronger distinction among each others
![image](/images/projects/vimeo/c1.png)

  - The filter types (Presets, New Filter, Saved Filters) have been moved to the left and aligned vertically as a side menu bar
  - The edit buttons for saved filters are more distinguishable after the update

  - The original thought was to keep the side navigation bar as simple as possible, but many users mentioned that they it will be super helpful to have short cuts to their reports, so the reports that are marked as important (starred) are showing directly on the side nav bar now

<div style={{
    display: "flex", 
    flexDirection: "row",
    flexWrap: "wrap",
    alignItems: "center",
    gap: "2rem",  
    margin: "2rem 0",
  }}
>
  <div style={{
    flex: "1 1 300px",
    minWidth: "300px",
  }}>
  ![image](/images/projects/vimeo/c31.png)
  </div>
  <div style={{
    flex: "1 1 300px",
    minWidth: "300px",
      display: "flex",
    flexDirection: "column",
    justifyContent: "center",
    alignItems: "center",
    textAlign: "center",
  }}>

  </div>
</div>

## Validate

After updating my designs, I ran another usability test within our team (8 people).

## Learnings & Next Steps
![image](/images/projects/vimeo/learn.jpg)

### Fail fast, fail often
- By implementing the Lean UX framework, I find myself more adaptable to failures during the design process
- More failures early on allows me to make so many small changes in such a short time, and those changes finally lead to something big

### It's about the tradeoff that matters
- When looking at multiple solutions to a problem, there is never a perfect one or a simple right or wrong answer
- When different opinions arise, the first thing is to prioritize our ultimate goal (i.e. satisfy most customers' needs to retain subscription rates; prioritize our enterprise customers' needs that leads to greater profits, etc.)
- The second thing is to understand how each solution compromises on a certain things that tradeoff for our end goal, then evaluate them based on those trade offs

### Be better at working with engineers
- This project teaches me how to prepare handoff documents for engineers, and it makes me realize the importance of having a well-organized structure when designing anything
- Going forward, I will keep training myself on having a beginner's mind, the ability to accept feedbacks, and the techniques that well equipped me for greater challenges
