## The Spark of an Idea

It all started with a conversation. A close friend, an engineer on Vimeo's video analytics team, confided in me about the struggles their users were facing.  The analytics section, a crucial tool for creators to understand their audience and video performance, was receiving a torrent of negative feedback.  He mentioned his team's desire to overhaul the UX/UI, but other projects always seemed to take precedence.  That's when the seed of a redesign project was planted. I saw an opportunity to not just solve a friend's problem, but to potentially impact the experience of countless Vimeo creators.

## Diving Deep: Understanding the Pain Points

My journey began with a deep dive into understanding the existing Vimeo analytics experience and, more importantly, the users' frustrations.  I partnered with Xiaoxin Ouyang, a product manager who generously shared her time and insights. Together, we embarked on a three-pronged research approach:

<div style={{ display: "flex",  flexDirection: "row", flexWrap: "wrap", alignItems: "start", gap: "2rem",  margin: "0",}}>
  
  <div style={{ flex: "1 1 200px", minWidth: "200px", display: "flex", flexDirection: "column", justifyContent: "center", alignItems: "center", }}>
![image](/images/projects/vimeo/Icon_lightbulb.png)
#### Step 1
**Immersing in Vimeo's World:**  Explored Vimeo's design language and analytics features to understand platform aesthetics and functionality. 
  </div>

  <div style={{ flex: "1 1 200px", minWidth: "200px", display: "flex", flexDirection: "column", justifyContent: "center", alignItems: "center", }}>
  ![image](/images/projects/vimeo/Icon_user.png)
#### Step 2
**Listening to the Users:** Analyzed 6000+ customer feedback reports, categorizing and summarizing data to identify pain points.
</div>

  <div style={{ flex: "1 1 200px", minWidth: "200px", display: "flex", flexDirection: "column", justifyContent: "center", alignItems: "center", }}>
  ![image](/images/projects/vimeo/Icon_research.png)
#### Step 3
**Exploring the Landscape:**  Competitive analysis of other video platforms' analytics revealed best practices and innovation opportunities.
</div>

</div>

{/* <div style={{ display: "flex",  flexDirection: "row", flexWrap: "wrap", alignItems: "center", gap: "2rem",  margin: "2rem 0",}}> */}
  
  {/* <div style={{ flex: "1 1 200px", minWidth: "200px", display: "flex", flexDirection: "column", justifyContent: "center", alignItems: "center", }}> */}
{/* ![image](/images/projects/vimeo/Icon_lightbulb.png) */}
{/* ### Step 1 */}
{/* Understand Vimeo's design language and the video analytics section's design and feature.  */}
  {/* </div> */}

  {/* <div style={{ flex: "1 1 200px", minWidth: "200px", display: "flex", flexDirection: "column", justifyContent: "center", alignItems: "center", }}> */}
  {/* ![image](/images/projects/vimeo/Icon_user.png) */}
  {/* ### Step 2 */}
{/* Read, categorize, and summarize over 6000 feedbacks from the Customer Satisfaction Report. */}
{/* </div> */}
 {/* <div style={{ flex: "1 1 200px", minWidth: "200px", display: "flex", flexDirection: "column", justifyContent: "center", alignItems: "center", }}> */}
  {/* ![image](/images/projects/vimeo/Icon_research.png) */}
{/* ### Step 3 */}
{/* Do market research on competitors' video analytics feature and summarize for improvements. */}
{/* </div> */}

{/* </div> */}

{/* 1.  **Immersing in Vimeo's World:** I spent time exploring Vimeo's overall design language and the specific functionalities of the video analytics section.  This gave me a baseline understanding of the platform's aesthetic and existing features. */}

{/* 2.  **Listening to the Users:** We pored over 6000+ pieces of customer feedback from the Customer Satisfaction Report.  We meticulously categorized and summarized this wealth of information, uncovering recurring themes and pain points. */}

{/* 3.  **Exploring the Landscape:**  We conducted a competitive analysis, examining how other video platforms handled analytics.  This helped us identify best practices and potential areas for innovation. */}

#### Research Results

Our research painted a clear picture.  Creators were struggling with:

*   **A Cluttered Dashboard:**  The dashboard was overwhelming, requiring endless scrolling to find even basic information. Key metrics were buried, not visualized, and offered little control over customization.
*   **A Frustrating Filter:**  The filtering process was cumbersome, requiring too many clicks and lacking essential features like folder-based filtering and the ability to save frequently used filters.
*   **Disjointed Reports:**  Different report types lived on separate pages, making it difficult to gain a holistic view of video performance.  Editing and sharing options were severely limited.

##### 4. Unveiling the Story of a Single Video (New Feature)

{/* Customers are now able to get comprehensive knowledge about any single video that they published. From how the impressions led to the total watch time to where the majority of viewers are located at; from how the audiences engage with each second of the video to how the video performed this week compared to last week, and more. Users can customize the graph's dimensions according to their own preferences. They will even get tips on how to improve their future contents.  */}
I also designed a new feature: a dedicated "Single Video Analytics" page. This allowed creators to drill down into the performance of individual videos, understanding everything from viewer demographics and watch time to engagement metrics and week-over-week comparisons. It even offered tips for improving future content.

<div
style={{
    display: "flex", 
    flexDirection: "row",
    flexWrap: "wrap",
    alignItems: "start",
    gap: "2rem",  
    margin: "0",
  }}
>
  <div style={{
    flex: "1 1 200px",
    minWidth: "200px",
      display: "flex",
    flexDirection: "column",
    justifyContent: "left",
    alignItems: "left",
  }}>
  ##### Video's version

  ![image](/images/projects/vimeo/v1.jpg)

  ##### Special feature for webinar ->
For webinars, a special version provided an email list of attendees and highlighted key data points for the host.
  {/* <li> Account that hosts webinar sessions will be able to see an email list of their audience. </li> */}
  {/* <li> Cards above the email list table highlights some important data for account owner to skim through. </li> */}

  </div>
  <div style={{
    flex: "1 1 200px",
    minWidth: "200px",
      display: "flex",
    flexDirection: "column",
    justifyContent: "left",
    alignItems: "left",
    
  }}>

  ##### Webinar (live stream)'s version

<p>&nbsp;</p>
##### 5. Organizing it All: Report Settings (New Feature)

{/* Users can now organize all the previously downloaded reports and saved filters in the Report Settings Page now. */}
Finally, a new "Report Settings" page provided a central hub for managing downloaded reports and saved filters.
<div
style={{
    display: "flex", 
    flexDirection: "row",
    flexWrap: "wrap",
    alignItems: "start",
    gap: "2rem",  
    margin: "0",
  }}
>
  <div style={{
    flex: "1 1 200px",
    minWidth: "200px",
      display: "flex",
    flexDirection: "column",
    justifyContent: "left",
    alignItems: "left",
  }}>

  ##### Download Center

## Testing and Refining: The Check Phase

The designs weren't created in a vacuum.  Quick testing sessions with users and discussions with Vimeo engineers provided invaluable feedback.  We discovered insights that led to immediate design adjustments, ensuring the final product was truly user-centered.


*   Horizontal filter categories were more intuitive.
*   Tabs require stronger visual distinction.

{/* After a few quick testings with some users and meetings with Vimeo engineers, we identified a few issues and make changes right away. */}

  {/* - It's more user friendly to put filter categories horizontally on the top */}
  {/* - The bars at the top need stronger distinction among each others */}

  {/* - The updated design improves filter usability through horizontal categories and enhanced tab visual distinction. */}

***
*   Users requested report shortcuts in the side navigation; starred reports are now directly accessible there.

<div style={{
    display: "flex", 
    flexDirection: "row",
    flexWrap: "wrap",
    alignItems: "center",
    gap: "2rem",  
    margin: "0",
  }}
>
  <div style={{
    flex: "1 1 200px",
    minWidth: "200px",
  }}>

  </div>
  <div style={{
    flex: "1 1 200px",
    minWidth: "200px",
      display: "flex",
    flexDirection: "column",
    justifyContent: "center",
    alignItems: "center",
  }}>

## Lessons Learned and Looking Ahead

![image](/images/projects/vimeo/learn.jpg)

This project was a powerful reminder of the importance of:

*   **Embracing Failure:** Adopting Lean UX principles meant embracing experimentation and iteration, which proved essential for quick learning from design mistakes.
*   **Understanding Tradeoffs:**  Prioritizing effectively is crucial when design requires balancing competing needs.
*   **Collaboration:**  Meaningful collaboration with engineers and stakeholders throughout the project proved crucial in ensuring a streamlined and truly successful process.

The redesigned Vimeo video analytics section represents a significant step forward in empowering creators with the data they need to succeed.  The journey emphasized the transformative power of user-centered design, and I'm excited to continue iterating and improving the experience based on ongoing user feedback.

{/* ### Fail fast, fail often */}
{/* - By implementing the Lean UX framework, I find myself more adaptable to failures during the design process */}
{/* - More failures early on allows me to make so many small changes in such a short time, and those changes finally lead to something big */}

{/* ### It's about the tradeoff that matters */}
{/* - When looking at multiple solutions to a problem, there is never a perfect one or a simple right or wrong answer */}
{/* - When different opinions arise, the first thing is to prioritize our ultimate goal (i.e. satisfy most customers' needs to retain subscription rates; prioritize our enterprise customers' needs that leads to greater profits, etc.) */}
{/* - The second thing is to understand how each solution compromises on a certain things that tradeoff for our end goal, then evaluate them based on those trade offs */}

{/* ### Be better at working with engineers */}
{/* - This project teaches me how to prepare handoff documents for engineers, and it makes me realize the importance of having a well-organized structure when designing anything */}
{/* - Going forward, I will keep training myself on having a beginner's mind, the ability to accept feedbacks, and the techniques that well equipped me for greater challenges */}
