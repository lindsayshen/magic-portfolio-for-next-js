## 1. Project Overview

The J.P. Morgan Access North Star Vision involved proactively breaking down silos and converging redundant experiences to modernize J.P. Morgan Access.  As a UX Designer, I co-led the strategic vision and workflow definition, directly influencing the product roadmap and leading the design of key payment management features.

## 2. The Challenge

The existing 12-year-old J.P. Morgan Access platform, serving over 400,000 corporate users, had a fragmented user experience and presented opportunities to improve payment management efficiency and reduce operational risks.  Key challenges included:

*   **Legacy System and Outdated Experience:**  The platform's age resulted in limitations in usability, real-time information, and proactive notifications.
*   **Diverse User Needs:** The platform needed to cater to a wide range of personas, from CEOs/CFOs to Treasury Analysts, within medium-to-large corporations.
*   **Long-Standing Need for Modernization:**  Previous modernization research lacked clear direction.
*   **Fragmented Payment Management:** Users had to navigate multiple sections for payments, templates, inquiries, and tracking.
*   **Need for a Progressive Client Experience:** A seamless transition was needed for clients migrating from RING to Access.
*   **Evolving Design System:**  The project coincided with the merger of two design systems (Pepper and Payments UI).
*   **Ambiguity and Prior Research:**  The project required synthesizing extensive prior research and navigating ambiguity.
* **User Needs (High level)**: Users needed a centralized, intuitive platform with real time visibility, efficient template management, streamlined inquiry handling, proactive notifications and a modern interface.
