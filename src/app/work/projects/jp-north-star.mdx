## ✨ Executive Summary

**Access Uplift** is J.P. Morgan’s strategic initiative to modernize its enterprise treasury platform — J.P. Morgan Access — used by **over 400,000** corporate clients globally. Faced with aging infrastructure and fragmented workflows, the platform needed a cohesive UX strategy to scale, streamline operations, and meet modern client needs.

I **helped lead** the North Star vision and later led design execution for critical workflows, including Payment Templates and Payment Overview, which shaped the **2024–2026** product roadmap.

This work helped position Access as an adaptable, client-centric platform — and laid the foundation for a future-ready treasury experience. In early 2024, J.P. Morgan Access was ranked the **No.1 platform in Payments and Treasury Management by Coalition Greenwich** — underscoring the strategic value of this transformation.

## 📌 1. Project Overview

The J.P. Morgan Access North Star Vision was a strategic effort to modernize and unify the experience across one of the most widely used platforms in corporate treasury. Serving **over 400,000 corporate treasury professionals** globally, J.P. Morgan Access plays a critical role in how enterprises manage payments, cash, and reporting.

As a designer, I **co-led** the North Star vision and helped lay the design foundation for future implementation. This included facilitating cross-functional alignment, creating concept journeys and wireframes, and guiding the transition into detailed design and delivery of key features like Payment Templates and Payment Overview.

**The goal**: elevate user experience standards and set a future-ready design direction — helping J.P. Morgan Access evolve from a functional system to a client-centric platform that scales across industries and regions.

## 🚧 2. The Challenge

Corporate treasury professionals faced major inefficiencies in managing cash flow and payments. Fragmented workflows, inconsistent task experiences, limited visibility into critical actions, and a heavy reliance on manual processes slowed down operations, increased cognitive burden, and introduced operational risk as payment volumes and client expectations continued to grow.

In early 2024, J.P. Morgan’s client service center reported a **30% increase in support calls** related to payment delays and processing errors. Rising operational risks and client service trends pointed to a potential **15% increase in financial discrepancies by 2025**, highlighting systemic impacts that could no longer be addressed through isolated fixes or incremental improvements.

This revealed a significant opportunity: to reimagine the Access platform with a unified experience — streamlining payment creation, standardizing task models, enhancing navigation clarity, and proactively surfacing critical actions. Our goal was to create a scalable, intuitive system that empowers treasury teams while reducing operational costs for J.P. Morgan.

## ⚙️ 4. The Process

### 🚀 Phase 1: North Star Vision (2022–2023)

To drive alignment and modernize the experience, I helped lead a North Star strategy that laid the foundation for execution:

##### Problem Framing
The existing platform had accumulated over a decade of fragmented workflows, inconsistent UI patterns, and technical constraints. Users faced inefficiencies due to outdated architecture, limited real-time capabilities, and siloed processes across payments, reporting, and inquiries. Our first step was to clearly articulate these systemic issues and reframe them into actionable problem statements that aligned with both user needs and business priorities.

After identifying key systemic issues, we facilitated cross-functional workshops — including storyboarding sessions, journey mapping, and persona deep-dives — to synthesize insights and drive early concept ideation.
