## ‚öôÔ∏è 4. The Process

### üöÄ Phase 1: North Star Vision (2022‚Äì2023)

To drive alignment and modernize the experience, I helped lead a North Star strategy that laid the foundation for execution:

#### Problem Framing
The existing platform had accumulated over a decade of fragmented workflows, inconsistent UI patterns, and technical constraints. Users faced inefficiencies due to outdated architecture, limited real-time capabilities, and siloed processes across payments, reporting, and inquiries. Our first step was to clearly articulate these systemic issues and reframe them into actionable problem statements that aligned with both user needs and business priorities.

After identifying key systemic issues, we facilitated cross-functional workshops ‚Äî including storyboarding sessions, journey mapping, and persona deep-dives ‚Äî to synthesize insights and drive early concept ideation.

#### Workshop Highlights

### üõ†Ô∏è Phase 2: Feature Execution (2024‚ÄìPresent)

After securing alignment on the North Star vision, we transitioned into execution by prioritizing key user journeys for redesign. I led the end-to-end UX for two critical workflows: Payment Templates and Payment Overview.

##### üí° Feature Spotlight: Payment Templates

A streamlined interface for managing and reusing templates across payment types.

- Replaced legacy table structure with modular cards
- Integrated role-based filtering and Save View logic
- Focused on speed, personalization, and visibility of approval flows

##### üí° Feature Spotlight: Payment Overview

A consolidated dashboard offering a real-time snapshot of payment status, errors, approvals, and next steps.

- Built around the JTBD (Jobs-To-Be-Done) framework
- Designed for glanceable status and proactive alerts
- Aligns with real user priorities: exceptions, batch status, approvals

## üß† 6. Lessons Learned & Next Steps

![image](/images/projects/north-star/lesson_2.jpg)

### ü™ê What I Learned

- **Anchor strategy by organizing what‚Äôs already known.**  
  Early on, I learned that before designing solutions, it‚Äôs critical to ground the team by gathering existing research, client feedback, and cross-team insights ‚Äî creating shared understanding and building early momentum.

- **Clarify who you are designing for ‚Äî and why.**  
  Working through fragmented personas taught me that setting clear, foundational goals is essential. Leadership‚Äôs advice ‚Äî *"Raise the floor, and raise the ceiling"* ‚Äî helped us balance serving everyday users while still enabling depth for power users.

- **Prioritize clarity over complexity when socializing a vision.**  
  Faced with numerous pain points, I realized that presenting a clear, high-level direction ‚Äî supported by just enough evidence ‚Äî was critical for gaining stakeholder alignment and unlocking broader execution support.

- **Strategic UX can influence more than design ‚Äî it can shape direction.**  
  Crafting a cohesive North Star vision helped align product, design, and technology teams around future goals, contributing to the evolution of the Access platform roadmap.

### üìç Next Steps

- **Advance the Payment Overview experience from MVP to full adoption.**  
  Continue refining key workflows, surfacing actionable insights, and driving cross-team collaboration toward a scalable, client-centric solution.

- **Scale modernization across remaining Payment workflows.**  
  Collaborate with adjacent teams to extend North Star principles across Pay-Out, Pay-In, and Reporting journeys ‚Äî ensuring consistency and operational efficiency.

- **Deepen research validation and measure impact.**  
  Partner with research to track user adoption, uncover emerging needs, and prioritize iterative improvements based on real client behaviors.

- **Explore future innovation opportunities.**  
  Investigate enhancements like proactive payment tracking, exception resolution flows, and predictive insights to strengthen operational resiliency and client trust.
