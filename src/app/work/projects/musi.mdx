## The Genesis of MUSI: Music, Connection, and a Pandemic Spark

During the isolating months of Covid, people sought new ways to connect. This global shift sparked an idea: **Could music bridge isolation and language barriers?** This led to MUSI: a music app for enjoyment, friendships, and language learning. If such an app existed, it would be **MUSI.**

{/* ![image](/images/projects/musi/casestudybrief.png) */}
#### Case Study Brief

**Product:** MUSI - a music app for language learning and community.


**My Roles:** UX/UI Design, User Research, Wireframing, Low/High-Fidelity Design, Prototyping, User Testing, Usability Testing, Design Validation.

**Framework:** Design Thinking

**Tools:** Figma, Photoshop, Marvel

#### Project Background

This project contains methods and ideas that I’ve learned while taking the **Google UX Design Professional Certificate Course**.
My goal is to create a platform for for users to enjoy music, share thoughts, learn languages, and connect with music lovers.
#### Challenges

{/* According to data from statista.com, **digital music and downloads** only contributed 5.8% (about 1.2 billion USD) revenue to the global music market, as the majority consumers turned to online streaming services.   */}
{/* The main challenge is to create a meaningful relationship with our customers. They can trust our service whenever they want to entertain, make new friends, join communities, and improve their knowledge skills, etc. Another challenge is to attract and retain subscribers through the details. For example, we need to do more user testings on what content should be used for the premium download button, etc. */}

{/* Market research revealed a key insight: digital music downloads contribute a small portion of music market revenue, with streaming dominating.  The main challenge was creating meaningful customer relationships beyond simple streaming. MUSI needed to be a trusted platform for entertainment, connection, community, and language learning. Attracting and retaining subscribers required user-centric details, emphasizing user testing to validate design and premium features. */}

A User-Centric Problem. Music consumers, particularly those interested in language learning and community, have trouble finding music apps that offer meaningful connection, community, and language learning integration beyond basic streaming entertainment. This is because the digital music market is saturated with streaming services focused primarily on music entertainment, neglecting these deeper user needs.  Therefore, we aim to create MUSI – a user-centric platform integrating music enjoyment, language learning, and community features to establish meaningful user relationships, attract/retain subscribers, and differentiate MUSI in the market.

## The Design Process

#### Empathize: Understanding the User's Tune
The journey began with empathy.  To understand user needs and the existing landscape, I surveyed social platforms (Facebook, Blind, Discord) about user perceptions of music apps – PROS and CONS. What do users love? What are the pain points? What's missing?

{/* I did a research on how customer think about some main music apps currently on the market.  Before an idea is formed, it is critical to understand the PROS and CONS that our competitors offer. */}

#### Define: Personas and Journeys

Interviews with 4 participants (friends and Discord users) helped define user needs.  I created Personas and User Journey Maps, guiding design decisions by focusing on user experience.

#### Ideate: Visualizing User Flow

I sketched User Flow Charts, mapping key user pathways to identify potential friction points before wireframing.

#### Wireframe Highlights: Building Structure

In Figma, I built Wireframes to establish the app's structure, focusing on information architecture, content hierarchy, and core interactions for an intuitive user flow.

#### Test & Revisions: Iterative Feedback

Usability tests with 6 participants provided feedback, driving iterative design improvements. User testing highlighted areas for refinement. Insights fueled design updates.
{/* After conducting usability tests with 6 participants,  gathered their feedbacks and updated my design (examples below). */}

### Accessibility & Inclusivity: Design for Everyone

{/* After taking the A11y Color Contrast Checker Test as well as several other Visual Simulator Tests, I have more understanding on how important color contrast is to people with other types of vision (i.e. Protanopia, Deuteranopia, Tritanopia, etc). */}
Prioritizing accessibility, I used A11y Color Contrast Checker and Visual Simulator Tests to understand color contrast for users with visual impairments. This led to:

*   **Daytime/Nighttime Versions:** Light/dark themes for readability.
*   **Customizable Color Palette:** User flexibility and personalization.
*   **MUSI CARE Mode:** Adjustable text sizes for readability.

<ol type="1">
  <li>I decided to add daytime/nighttime version for people to choose from.</li>
  <li>For an even better experience, I added a color palette to maximize flexibility.</li>
</ol>

#### Subscription Model: Balancing Business & Value
{/* After all, design is not just about visuals or experiences, it’s also about business. Below shows a few examples of how customers might experience the MUSI app before and after their subscriptions. */}
To explore subscriptions, I hypothesized: **Clear subscription privileges increase user conversion?** I created before/after subscription experience examples, highlighting the value proposition of premium subscriptions. This needs further data, but highlights UX impact on business goals.

**My hypothesis** is: more users would subscribe to our app if they can easily distinguish the privileges they have after their subscriptions. However, I need more data to confirm my hypothesis.

## Validate

{/* After 3 weeks of user research, user analysis and design reiteration, I was able to validate the assumptions and changes I had made. I tested my clickable Figma prototype with 6 new participants. */}
After 3 weeks of research, analysis, and iteration, usability tests with 6 new participants validated the design direction and user-centered approach. Positive feedback and smooth flows confirmed the improvements.

## Learnings & Next Steps

![image](/images/projects/musi/musilast.png)

{/* *   Teamwork brings efficiency. The current high fidelity designs show only parts of the user experience. Many other details still need to be tested and redesigned. For example, I need to run tests on the complete karaoke experience, including all the features involved, to make sure problems are discovered and peoples’ needs are understood. I would like to spend more time collecting data on how people like to use the karaoke feature and how often they use it… */}
Teamwork and iteration are key learnings.  The current designs are a part of the user experience; further testing is needed, especially for Karaoke and Streaming Rooms. MUSI aims to be a platform for connection, learning, and shared experiences through music. This case study is a step towards that vision, and I'm excited to continue refining MUSI based on user feedback.
#### Next steps

*   **Deep Dive into Karaoke & Streaming UX:** Usability tests on Karaoke/Streaming features.
*   **Gather Feature Usage Data:** Track Karaoke feature usage.
*   **Explore Community Features:** Research and design iterations for deeper social interaction.
