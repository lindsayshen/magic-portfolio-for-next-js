## Case Study: MUSI - Learn Languages Through Music

During Covid, people started to look for new ways to concentrate, communicate, and connect. An idea came across my mind: wouldn’t it be nice to have a music app that not only let you **enjoy music**, but also help you **make friends, learn and practice a new language?** If there is one, I will name it **MUSI** :P

### Case Study Brief

**Product:** a music app


**My Roles:** UX/UI Design, User Research, Wireframing, Low/High-Fidelity Design, Prototyping, User Testing, Usability Testing, Design Validation

**Framework:** Design Thinking

**Tools:** Figma, Photoshop, Marvel



### Project Background

This project contains methods and ideas that I’ve learned while taking the **Google UX Design Professional Certificate Course**.
My goal is to create a platform for people to enjoy music, share their thoughts, learn and practice a new language, and connect with other music lovers.

### Challenges

According to data from statista.com, **digital music and downloads** only contributed 5.8% (about 1.2 billion USD) revenue to the global music market, as the majority consumers turned to online streaming services.  
The main challenge is to create a meaningful relationship with our customers. They can trust our service whenever they want to entertain, make new friends, join communities, and improve their knowledge skills, etc. Another challenge is to attract and retain subscribers through the details. For example, we need to do more user testings on what content should be used for the premium download button, etc.

## The Design Process

### Empathize
Before a real idea is formed, I started a survey and shared it on social medias (Facebook, Blind, and Discord).

I did a research on how customer think about some main music apps currently on the market.  Before an idea is formed, it is critical to understand the PROS and CONS that our competitors offer.

### Define

After interviewing 4 participants (2 are my friends, the other 2 are random participants that I found on discord), I built up personas and created user journey maps to inspire and inform my design decisions.

### Test & Revisions (Iterative Process)

After conducting usability tests with 6 participants,  gathered their feedbacks and updated my design (examples below).

### More Tests & Revisions: Accessibility and Inclusivity
After taking the A11y Color Contrast Checker Test as well as several other Visual Simulator Tests, I have more understanding on how important color contrast is to people with other types of vision (i.e. Protanopia, Deuteranopia, Tritanopia, etc).

<ol type="1">
  <li>I decided to add daytime/nighttime version for people to choose from.</li>
  <li>For an even better experience, I added a color palette to maximize flexibility.</li>
</ol>

### The Controversial Details: Subscription Model
After all, design is not just about visuals or experiences, it’s also about business. Below shows a few examples of how customers might experience the MUSI app before and after their subscriptions.


**My hypothesis** is: more users would subscribe to our app if they can easily distinguish the privileges they have after their subscriptions. However, I need more data to confirm my hypothesis.

## Validate

After 3 weeks of user research, user analysis and design reiteration, I was able to validate the assumptions and changes I had made. I tested my clickable Figma prototype with 6 new participants.

## Learnings & Next Steps

*   Teamwork brings efficiency. The current high fidelity designs show only parts of the user experience. Many other details still need to be tested and redesigned. For example, I need to run tests on the complete karaoke experience, including all the features involved, to make sure problems are discovered and peoples’ needs are understood. I would like to spend more time collecting data on how people like to use the karaoke feature and how often they use it…
