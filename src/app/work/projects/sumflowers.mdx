## Case Study: Sum Flowers - A Seamless B2C Experience

In 2020, an app-based startup called Sum Flowers was founded in New York City. The company aims to provide a **convenient platform** for florists and customers to sell and buy **customizable** bouquets and get them delivered **within an hour.**




### Case Study Brief

**Products:** A flower ordering app (for customers); a flower selling app (for florists)

**My Roles:** UX/UI Design, User Research, Branding, Wireframing, Low/High-Fidelity Design, Prototyping, Usability Testing

**Framework:** Design Thinking

**Tools:** Figma, Photoshop, Marvel

<hr/>
### Company Background

**Business:** An app-based startup that provides convenient flower order and fast (1 hour) delivery service.

**Operating Locations:** New York City, San Francisco
<hr/>

### Challenges

**For customer's app:** To make the process of selecting a delivery location, delivery time, product and payment method seamless and intuitive, as well as to give customers confidence that their product will arrive on time and in great condition.

**For florist's app:** To provide smooth transitions from initial signups to receiving notifications about new eligible orders, as well as making the process of receiving, prepping, delivering, and being paid for orders simple and trustworthy.

## Learnings & Next Steps
![image](/images/projects/sumflowers/learn.jpeg)
This is not only a project that I did all by myself, but also my very **first** time designing an end-to-end mobile app. It was challenging yet encouraging. Apart from the basic design skills I learned, I realized that **usability tests** are crucial and should be conducted more frequently at an earlier stage of the design process. Testings are important for **human-centered design**. After conducting **more usability tests** on the high-fidelity designs, I am planning to dig deeper into **Photoshop** to refine some design details.
