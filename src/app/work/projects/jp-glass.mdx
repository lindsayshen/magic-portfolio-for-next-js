## 1. Project Overview

As the Experience Lead, I was responsible for redesigning the GLASS internal dashboard, a critical tool for JPMC sales teams.  The project aimed to improve sales team efficiency and client management by creating a streamlined workflow and improving data accessibility.

## 2. The Challenge

JPMorgan Chase's internal sales teams relied on the GLASS platform to manage client portfolios.  However, salespeople faced significant challenges:

*   **Fragmented Systems:**  Salespeople had to access multiple systems to get a complete picture of their client portfolios.
*   **Information Overload:** The existing dashboard presented an overwhelming amount of data, making it difficult to identify key insights.
*   **Data Currency:** Data wasn't always current, leading to potential missed opportunities or inaccurate client information.
*   **Non-Intuitive Interface:**  The interface caused a steep learning curve and user frustration.
*   **Inefficient Data Extraction:** Sales and Operation specialists spent hours daily, quarterly, and yearly extracting and analyzing global customer cash flow data.
* **User Needs**: Salespeople required a unified portfolio view with real-time, personalized data, actionable insights, and easy navigation, tailored to their specific role (senior vs. junior sales).

## 3. My Role & Responsibilities

As the Experience Lead, I spearheaded the UX efforts, collaborating with a team including one Experience Associate, two Product Owners, and the development team.  My responsibilities included:

*   **User Research:** Conducted user interviews with sales representatives (various regions and experience levels) and performed contextual inquiry to observe salespeople using the existing system.
*   **Persona Development:** Developed user personas (documented in project deliverables) based on research and supplemental 1-on-1 interviews.
*   **Process Innovation:** Introduced and guided the team through the double diamond design process (Discover, Define, Develop, Deliver), creating a project roadmap to visualize and validate prioritization with POs.
*   **Stakeholder Management:** Led weekly working sessions with product owners, presenting concepts, gathering feedback, and ensuring alignment with business goals. I fostered alignments by respecting and listening to everyone's opinion.
*   **Information Architecture:** Created user flow diagrams to map existing and proposed workflows, identifying areas for simplification.
*   **Interaction Design:** Designed wireframes and interactive prototypes (using Figma) to explore design solutions, focusing on usability and clarity.
*   **Usability Testing:** Conducted usability testing with salespeople (3-5 users, as planned in the project brief) to validate design decisions.
*   **Collaboration with Development:** Worked closely with developers, ensuring adherence to JPMC design standards and accessibility guidelines.  Piloted a new design process with creative technologist James Sol to improve design handoff.
*   **Data Analysis:** Collaborated with the CX team to analyze historical user behavior data (using Matomo) to identify key usage patterns and critical features for our primary personas.
* **Efficient & Ownership**: Drafted complex filter requirements for POs which increased efficiency and moved us forward in the process.
* **Efficient & Innovative**: Positively interacted with the UI Toolkit team and contributed to new component use cases for future updates.
* **Ownership**: Spent significant time researching GLASS Portfolio View and included information in the project brief.
*  **Delivers the Firm**: Shared benefits of leveraging project briefs in collaborations with product teams at the Payments weekly team meeting.

## 4. The Process

The redesign followed the double-diamond design process:

*   **Discover:** User interviews and contextual inquiry revealed frustrations with data silos and the unintuitive interface.  As Raina Sanjay Shah (CFV) noted in my performance review, I was "very quick in ramping up and understood the product very fast."
*   **Define:** We defined key user needs (real-time data, personalized views, actionable insights, easy navigation).  We prioritized features based on user impact and business value. I collaborated with the product manager to create a detailed filter requirements document, and pushed for usability research to make data-informed design decisions.
*   **Develop:** We created low-fidelity wireframes to explore layout options and information hierarchies.  The design exploration included a review of industry best practices for complex filtering systems.  We iterated based on stakeholder feedback and usability testing, developing high-fidelity prototypes. Recognizing the complexity of filtering (identified as a key risk), we prioritized iterative design and close stakeholder collaboration.
*   **Deliver:** I worked closely with developers to implement the final design, ensuring adherence to JPMC design standards and accessibility guidelines, and created a comprehensive and detailed handoff document.

## 5. The Solution

The redesigned GLASS dashboard features a modular, card-based layout, allowing salespeople to customize their view and focus on relevant information. Key features include:

*   **Real-time Data Updates:**  Salespeople have access to the most current information.
*   **Clear Visual Hierarchy:** Key metrics and alerts are prominently displayed.
*   **Improved Search and Filtering:**  Enhanced capabilities for finding specific clients or information.
*   **System Integration:** Seamless integration with other JPMC systems.
*   **Data Visualization:** Clear charts and graphs for effective communication.
*   **Adherence to Standards:**  While adhering to JPMC's design system, we optimized the interface for the specific needs of GLASS users, balancing familiarity with enhanced usability.

## 6. Results & Impact

The redesigned GLASS dashboard MVP was successfully handed off to the development team, with an expected launch in Q1 2023.

**Qualitative:**

*   Significantly improved user satisfaction, with salespeople reporting that the new dashboard is more intuitive and efficient.
*   Reduced time spent gathering information.
*   Positive feedback from stakeholders on improved usability and data presentation.  As Arthur Manelis (GLASS) noted, I was "diligent to keep within our timelines," and Inde Kaur highlighted my contribution to establishing "reusable frameworks."

**Quantitative (Hypothetical):**

*   Reduced average time to complete key tasks (e.g., portfolio review) by 15%.
*   Increased user adoption rate by 20% compared to the previous system.

*(Note: Since the actual launch was in Q1 2023, you should replace these hypothetical metrics with *real* data if possible. If you don't have access to precise numbers, you could rephrase this section to focus on anticipated impact based on qualitative feedback and initial observations.)*

## 7. Lessons Learned/Next Steps

*   The project reinforced the value of proactive communication, stakeholder engagement, and clear processes.
*   The research phase was invaluable in understanding user workflows.
*   Collaborative decision-making is crucial, especially with complex design challenges like filtering.
*   The project reinforced the value of establishing clear process to drive efficiency and collaboration.
* The project highlighted the value of user-centered design, even for internal tools.
*   The project solidified my commitment to continuous learning (pursuing design thinking training at eCornell).
* Showed the value of incorporating wins for internal customers via the external customer strategy.
*   The project also reinforced the importance of sharing knowledge and fostering a positive team environment.

**Next Steps:**

*   Gather post-launch user feedback and iterate on the design.
*   Track key performance indicators (KPIs) to measure the success of the redesign.
*   Explore additional features and integrations based on user needs and business goals.
