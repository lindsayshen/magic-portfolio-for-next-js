{/*## Executive Summary*/}
## üìå Executive Summary

GLASS is an internal dashboard used by JPMorgan Chase sales teams to manage global client portfolios. The platform was hindered by fragmented tools, outdated data, and unintuitive workflows. I led the redesign effort to create a unified, real-time dashboard experience that empowers salespeople to focus on client engagement instead of manual data work.

While the full design was initially planned for a Q1 2023 launch, resource constraints postponed the rollout. However, core elements of the redesign were implemented through a Tableau-based interim solution, delivering immediate improvements to data access and workflow efficiency.

**My Role:** UX/UI Designer | 6-month project | Led end-to-end redesign  
**Impact:** Anticipated 50% reduction in data retrieval time. Interim Tableau tool delivered early efficiency gains prior to full implementation.

## üõ†Ô∏è 4. The Process: A Design Thinking Journey

The redesign of the GLASS dashboard was guided by the Double Diamond design process, a framework that emphasizes user-centered problem-solving. However, our process was not strictly linear; it involved iterations and revisiting of phases as new information emerged and the design evolved. Here's a detailed look at how we moved through each phase:

{/**   **Discover:** User interviews and contextual inquiry revealed frustrations with data silos and the unintuitive interface.
*   **Define:** We defined key user needs (real-time data, personalized views, actionable insights, easy navigation). We prioritized features based on user impact and business value. I collaborated with the product manager to create a detailed filter requirements document, and pushed for usability research to make data-informed design decisions.
*   **Develop:** I created low-fidelity wireframes to explore layout options and information hierarchies.  The design exploration included a review of industry best practices for complex filtering systems.  I iterated based on stakeholder feedback and usability testing, developing high-fidelity prototypes. Recognizing the complexity of filtering (identified as a key risk), I prioritized iterative design and close stakeholder collaboration.
*   **Deliver:** I worked closely with developers to implement the final design, ensuring adherence to JPMC design standards and accessibility guidelines, and created a comprehensive and detailed handoff document.*/}

{/*### 4.2 Deep Dive into Filtering Requirements*/}
### üßÆ 4.2 Filtering Requirements
Filtering was the most complex and critical part of the redesign. With diverse user roles ranging from junior sales assistants to regional leads, we needed a flexible, role-based filtering system that could surface relevant data quickly. I captured these needs in Excel to align with product managers‚Äô workflows, enabling structured review and shared understanding across stakeholders. This approach streamlined handoff, reduced miscommunication, and became a reference point for developers throughout implementation.
{/*Upon joining the project, I focused on a critical aspect of the redesign: the filtering process.

* **Complex Requirements and Diverse Personas**: We discovered a wide range of internal roles, varying in seniority and responsibilities, each with distinct needs and priorities for the dashboard view. This necessitated a nuanced approach to filtering, ensuring that each user could efficiently access their relevant data.
* **Clarifying Requirements with Excel**: To effectively capture these complex filtering requirements, I took the initiative to document them in Excel ‚Äî a tool familiar to our Product Managers. This approach served to create a structured format for role-based filtering needs, facilitate PM review and validation, ensure shared understanding among stakeholders, and streamline requirements gathering and communication.*/}

{/*### 4.3 Iterative Design and Validation*/}
### üîÅ 4.3 Iterative Design and Validation

We tested two design approaches to improve the filtering experience and ‚ÄúSave View‚Äù functionality. Based on feedback and efficiency metrics, we refined our solution to prioritize simplicity and clarity.

<p>&nbsp;</p>
<details>
  <summary><strong>Option 1: Separate Widget Customization</strong></summary>
  
  This option allowed users to configure filters and ‚ÄúView By‚Äù settings individually within each widget. However, testing revealed friction: saving a default view required multiple clicks, and interacting with time filters in side drawers slowed users down.

  > _User feedback:_ ‚ÄúData visualization is clear and filters are easy to use, gain of time.‚Äù
  
  ![image](/images/projects/jp-glass/s1.png)

</details>

<p>&nbsp;</p>
<details>
  <summary><strong>Option 2: Consolidated Page-Level Filtering</strong></summary>

  This approach enabled users to make all filter and visualization selections at the page level, reducing clicks and improving performance. It also introduced a dropdown-based ‚ÄúSave View‚Äù feature for easier default configuration.

  > _User feedback:_ ‚ÄúThe process of selecting options to view data is very clear...‚Äù
  
  ![image](/images/projects/jp-glass/s2.png)

  60% of users preferred this streamlined layout, citing better usability and clarity.

  ![image](/images/projects/jp-glass/g_sur.png)

</details>

<p>&nbsp;</p>
We used these results to refine the problem we were solving: not simply offering customization, but creating a filtering experience that balances flexibility, clarity, and speed ‚Äî optimized for real-world usage. Prioritizing performance and ease of use became key drivers in the final design direction.


{/*Our design process involved significant iteration and validation, particularly around the filtering functionality:

{/** **Prototyping and Usability Testing:** We conducted usability testing using UserZoom (click tests) and interviews with internal employees to understand their preferences for the filtering process and the placement of filters. This phase involved evaluating two distinct approaches to the "Save View" functionality:
    * **Option 1: Separate Widget Customization:** This option allowed users to configure filters and "View By" settings independently for each widget. However, usability testing revealed that saving a default view required multiple clicks ("Save and Apply" button), leading to a potentially cumbersome user experience. Additionally, users noted that selecting timeframes within the widget could be time-consuming due to the side drawer loading.
    ![image](/images/projects/jp-glass/Save1.png)
    _(User feedback from interview: "Data visualization is clear and filters are easy to use, gain of time")_
    * **Option 2: Consolidated Page-Level Filtering:** This option streamlined the process by having users make all filtering and data visualization selections at the page level. Timeframes and time comparisons were moved directly to the widget level. A "Save View" button with a dropdown menu allowed users to save their preferred configuration as the default view. 
    ![image](/images/projects/jp-glass/Save2.png)
    _(User feedback from interview: "...the process of selecting options to view visualized data is very clear..."; "Feature looks good and helpful to understand the client balance...")_
  * This approach (Option 2) simplified the process, reducing the number of clicks and improving efficiency. Users found this option simpler, clearer, and easier to use, as shown in survey results where 60% preferred Option 2.
 ![image](/images/projects/jp-glass/Survey_result.png)
* **Refining the Problem Definition:** The insights from these tests and interviews helped us to further refine our understanding of the problem. We learned that the filtering needed to be not only powerful but also intuitive and easily accessible within the dashboard interface. The iterative evaluation of Option 1 and Option 2 led to a key refinement of the problem definition:
    * **Initial Problem Definition:** "How to provide users with flexible view customization options."
    * **Refined Problem Definition:** "How to provide users with an efficient and intuitive way to customize and save dashboard views, balancing flexibility with ease of use and performance."
    * By prioritizing simplicity and efficiency based on user feedback, we aimed to reduce user effort and improve the overall experience of the GLASS dashboard.
